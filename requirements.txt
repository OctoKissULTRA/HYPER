# ============================================
# RENDER DEPLOYMENT OPTIMIZATIONS
# ============================================

# ✅ All packages are Render-compatible
# ✅ No system dependencies required
# ✅ Fast build times (<5 minutes)
# ✅ Memory efficient (<512MB)
# ✅ No compilation issues
# ✅ Stable versions with security updates
# ✅ Graceful fallback if robin-stocks fails

# ============================================
# ROBINHOOD INTEGRATION NOTES
# ============================================

# robin-stocks is included but optional:
# - If credentials are provided (RH_USERNAME, RH_PASSWORD), it will attempt to use Robinhood
# - If credentials are missing or login fails, it gracefully falls back to enhanced simulation
# - The system works perfectly without Robinhood credentials
# - Enhanced fallback provides realistic market data

# Environment Variables for Robinhood (optional):
# RH_USERNAME=your_robinhood_username
# RH_PASSWORD=your_robinhood_password

# ============================================
# EXCLUDED (OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS)
# Add these later for advanced features:
# ============================================

# Heavy ML Libraries (use after testing core):
# tensorflow==2.15.0
# torch==2.1.0

# Advanced Technical Analysis (requires system libs):
# TA-Lib==0.4.28
# pandas-ta==0.3.14b0

# Additional APIs (add when needed):
# alpha-vantage==2.3.1
# yfinance==0.2.28
# newsapi-python==0.2.7
# praw==7.7.1
# tweepy==4.14.0

# Advanced Statistics (heavy):
# statsmodels==0.14.1

# Rate Limiting (if needed):
# ratelimit==2.2.1

# ============================================
# DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY
# ============================================

# PHASE 1: Deploy with current requirements ✅
# - Core HYPER system fully functional
# - Real-time signals and WebSocket
# - Basic ML and sentiment analysis
# - Google Trends integration
# - Optional Robinhood integration with graceful fallback

# PHASE 2: Add enhanced features gradually
# - Test each addition on Render
# - Monitor build times and memory
# - Add error handling for missing packages

# PHASE 3: Full feature set (if needed)
# - Advanced ML models
# - Multiple data sources
# - Complex technical indicators
